# Mumbai Mitra üåÜ

Mumbai Mitra is your ultimate digital companion for exploring and navigating Mumbai - India's city of dreams. Built with Next.js and React, this modern web application helps locals, newcomers, and tourists discover the best of Mumbai's neighborhoods, cultural hotspots, and urban experiences.
For most of the parts, we've got static information, we'll keep on adding to the data, or maybe get an API to fetch the information, but for now, the data is mostly static except the weather.
